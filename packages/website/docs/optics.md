# Optics

## Prior art

- [calmm-js/partial.lenses](https://github.com/calmm-js/partial.lenses) presents a very wide collection of optics from the JavaScript era.
- [optics-ts](https://akheron.github.io/optics-ts/) is my main inspiration for this project. Beside differences in ergonomics, I wanted something that was way less demanding on TypeScript compiler.
