# Finite State Machines

## Use cases

- replace multiple flags that do not freely combine
- think state then event

## Roadmap

- child states
- parallel states
- history states

## Prior art

- [XState](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate) is the most popular implementation of finite state machines in TypeScript. XState incorporates a full-featured event-driven programming system where Composer focus on representing state machine as pure functions.
